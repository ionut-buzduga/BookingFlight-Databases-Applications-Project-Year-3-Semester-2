# BookingFlight


Important!-If you wish to test the application, the most recent working Branch is the feature/EFIntegration branch
There you can see all the commits done by each member.

The majority of changes done by me are located in that branch(feature/EFIntegration) and in feature/EFIntegrationBI.

This is a group project for Databases Applications class.

Information about the project can be found in the main Branch in Flight Company, Flight Company Design and BookingFlight PP presentations
The database export file is named BookingFlightDb
